        The pixel size of the images in Angstrom.

        The angle of defocus astigmatism, in degrees.
    defocus_min : float
        The minimum relative defocus to consider, in um.
    defocus_max : float
        The maximum relative defocus to consider, in um.
    defocus_step : float
        The step size between defocus values, in um.
    amplitude_contrast_ratio : float, optional
        The amplitude contrast ratio, by default 0.07.
    spherical_aberration : float, optional
        The spherical aberration constant, in mm, by default 2.7.
    phase_shift : float, optional
        The phase shift constant, by default 0.0.
