# Leopard-EM

Welcome to the **L**ocation & ori**E**ntati**O**n of **PAR**ticles found using two-**D**imensional t**E**mplate **M**atching (Leopard-EM) online documentation!
Leopard-EM is a Python implementation of Two-Dimensional Template Matching (2DTM) which itself is a data processing method in cryo-EM for locating and orienting particles using a reference structure.
This package currently reflects the functionality described in Lucas, *et al.* (2021)[^1] with additional programs to maximize the usefulness of 2DTM as well as other user-friendly features for integrating into broader data science workflows.

!!! note "Citing this work"

    If you use Leopard-EM in your research, please cite (coming soon!).

## Installation

### Requirements

The general system requirements for Leopard-EM are

- Python version 3.10 or above
- PyTorch 2.4.0 or above
- Linux operating system

The package config contains a complete set of requirements which are automatically downloaded and checked during the installation process.
We also recommend using a virtual environment manager (such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) to avoid conflicts with other installed software on your system.
Please open a [open up a bug report](https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM/issues/new) on the GitHub page if you experience major issues during the installation process.

!!! caution "MacOS and Windows support"

    Leopard-EM should *theoretically* work on MacOS and Windows operating systems, but we cannot guarantee compatibility with platforms other than Linux nor do we distribute pre-built wheels for these platforms.

!!! caution "Tested GPU support"

    Leopard-EM has only been tested against NVIDIA GPUs but should run on most modern GPU hardware (supported by PyTorch).
    If you've experienced a compatibility issue, [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM/issues/new).


### Pre-packaged releases

Pre-packaged versions of Leopard-EM are released on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
To install the latest pre-packaged release of Leopard-EM, run the following:

```bash
pip install leopard-em
```

From there, you are ready to start running 2DTM workflows or exploring some of our examples.

### Installing from Source

If you want to install Leopard-EM from source, first clone the repository and install the package using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM.git
cd Leopard-EM
pip install .
```

### For Developers

Developers who are interested in contributing to Leopard-EM should fork the repository into their own GitHub account.
Navigate to the [Leopard-EM GitHub landing page](https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM) and click on fork in the top right-hand corner.
Then clone your fork and add the Lucaslab-Berkeley remote as an upstream:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Leopard-EM.git
cd Leopard-EM
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM
```

Check that the remote has been properly added (`git remote -v`) then run the following to install the package along with the optional development dependencies.

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,test,docs]'
```

See the [Contributing](#contributing) page for detailed guidelines on contributing to the package.

## Basic Usage

### Built-in programs

Leopard-EM is runnable through a set of pre-built Python scripts and easily modifiable YAML configurations.
There are currently five main programs (located under [`programs/` folder](https://github.com/Lucaslab-Berkeley/Leopard-EM/tree/main/programs)) each with their own configuration files.
Detailed documentation for each program can be found on the [Program Documentation Overview](programs/overview.md), but the five main programs are as follows:

1. `match_template` - Runs a whole orientation search for a given reference structure on a single micrograph.
2. `refine_template` - Takes particles identified from match template and refines their location, orientation, and defocus parameters.
3. `optimize_template` - Optimizes the pixel size of the micrograph and template structure model using a set of identified particles.
4. `constrained_search` - Uses the location and orientation of identified particles to constrain the search parameters of a second particle.
5. `optimize_b_factor.py` - Script to optimize the b-factor added to a model (using 2DTM) for a set of metrics.

<!-- A minimally working Python script for running the match template program is shown below -->

### Minimal match template example

The following Python script will run a basic match template program using only the built-in Pydantic models.
See the programs documentation page for more details on running each program.

```python
from leopard_em.pydantic_models.config import DefocusSearchConfig
from leopard_em.pydantic_models.config import OrientationSearchConfig

    pre_filters = PreprocessingFilters()

    # Which GPUs to run template matching on (here the first 2 GPUs)
    comp_config = ComputationalConfig(gpu_ids=[0, 1])

    # Bring all the other configs together in the manager
    mt_manager = MatchTemplateManager(
        micrograph_path="some_path/to/image.mrc",
        template_volume_path="some_path/to/volume.mrc",
        optics_group=my_optics_group,

    )
