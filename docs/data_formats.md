# Description of Data Formats

To increase interoperability between external packages, we herein describe the different data formats used as input to and export from programs.
Orientations on a per-particle bases are currently stored as [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#) in ZYZ format.
Note that the package is still under development and the exact way the data is represented might change in the future.

## Data from the match template program

The match template program collates statistics from a large number of cross-correlograms taken over an orientation and defocus search space.
See the API on the `MatchTemplateResult` object for further information on how these data are stored, but here we provide an overview of what files get written to disk.

### Best statistic maps
Each of the "best" statistics is stored on a per-position basis in what we dub "statistics maps" saved as `.mrc` files.
We have the following tracked statistics for each valid (x, y) position:

- Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP): Maximum cross-correlation value over all search orientations and relative defocus values.
- Scaled MIP (z-score or SNR): The MIP value normalized by the mean and variance of the cross-correlation over the entire search space.
- Correlation Mean: The mean of the cross-correlation values over the entire search space. Used to calculate the scaled MIP.
- Correlation Variance: The variance of the cross-correlation values over the entire search space. Used to calculate the scaled MIP.
- Phi: The \( \phi \) angle which (in degrees) produced the MIP value.
- Theta: The \( \theta \) angle (in degrees) which produced the MIP value.
- Psi: The \( \psi \) angle (in degrees) which produced the MIP value.
- Defocus: The relative defocus value (in Angstroms) which produced the MIP value.

#### A note on correlation modes and output shapes

Three general modes for convolution/correlation exist in digital signal processing: "full", "same", and "valid".
[This chapter of Digital Signals Theory](https://brianmcfee.net/dstbook-site/content/ch03-convolution/Modes.html) provides a good overview of these modes.

We support both the "same" and "valid" modes for cross-correlation.
For an image with shape \( (H, W) \) and template \( (h, w) \), the modes will output statistics maps with the following shapes:

- same: \( (H, W) \)
- valid: \( (H - h + 1, W - w + 1) \)

Note that same mode pads the image with zeros along the edges and *does not* increase the number of particles detectable; values along the padded portions of the edge do not hold significance in the context of the particle detection.
In each case, the position in the map at \( (i, j) \) corresponds to the top-left corner of the template at that position, *not* the center of the template.
Below is an example comparing the two correlation modes:

### Match template **DataFrame**

Since not all positions \( (x, y) \) contain a particle from the match template search, using only the statistics maps can be inefficient in terms of size and speed.
The match template manager class has the method `MatchTemplateManager.results_to_dataframe()` which automatically picks peaks within the scaled MIP map and stores the peak locations, orientations, and defocus values in a pandas DataFrame.

Additional columns besides locations and orientations are included in the DataFrame to increase the utility of the data, namely the construction of `ParticleStack` objects.
The columns and corresponding descriptions are as follows:
